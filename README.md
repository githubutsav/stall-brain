## 🎯 Problem Statement 

> *"Hazratganj's iconic street market has vendors who over-stock or under-stock daily, leading to waste and lost revenue. Build an agent that reads footfall patterns, weather, local events, and social buzz to recommend optimal daily procurement."*
>
> **Lucknow context:** Hazratganj · Janpath Market

Every morning, thousands of street vendors in Hazratganj make the same high-stakes guess: **how much stock should I buy today?**

They have no tools. They rely on gut feel, last week's memory, and WhatsApp forwards. The consequences are real:

- A vendor overbought potatoes on a rainy day — the crowd never came, the stock rotted.
- The next day, fearing rain again, he bought less — but it was an LSG match day, the streets were packed, and he sold out by 4 PM, losing thousands in revenue.

This isn't bad luck. It's a **data problem**. The signals exist — weather forecasts, event calendars, day-of-week patterns — but no one has put them together for a Hazratganj vendor. Bazaar Brain does exactly that.

---

## 💡 Solution

Bazaar Brain is a **multi-page agentic web app** that acts as a daily procurement advisor for street vendors. A vendor picks their stall type, customizes their item list, and the AI agent synthesizes live weather data, a Lucknow-specific event calendar, and weekly footfall patterns to produce a precise, actionable stock recommendation — in English and Hindi.

The AI doesn't just answer a prompt. It **reasons across multiple data signals** before generating output, making it genuinely agentic rather than a simple chatbot.

---

## ✨ Features

**Vendor Auth & Persistent Profiles**
Users sign up, log in, and keep their stall profile saved across sessions.

**Stall Type Selection (7 types)**
Seven vendor archetypes tailored to Hazratganj: Chaat, Chai, Juice, Flowers, Bhutta, Snacks & Namkeen, Balloon & Toy.

**Editable Ingredient Lists**
Profile ingredients are fully editable: add, remove, or rename items before saving.

**Current Inventory Input**
Vendors enter what they already have per item (quantity + unit), so the AI recommends only what to buy today.

**Live Lucknow Weather (Open-Meteo)**
Real-time weather for Hazratganj coordinates drives footfall impact multipliers.

**Lucknow Event Radar**
Local events and weekly patterns feed the demand calculation before the AI prompt is built.

**Demand Multiplier Engine**
The system computes:

```
Demand Multiplier = Weather Impact × Event Impact × Day-of-Week Pattern
```

**Smart Procurement Output**
Each item returns Total Needed, You Have, and Buy Today with priorities and notes.

**Bilingual Output (EN + HI)**
Forecasts include English and Hindi summaries with a one-click toggle.

**Forecast History & Feedback Loop**
Runs are stored locally with feedback and inventory snapshots for future reference.

## 🗺️ App Flow

```
Landing  →  Profile Setup  →  Forecast Page  →  AI Output
(welcome)    (stall +          (inventory +       (buy today
			 ingredients)       session edits)    breakdown)
```

Your stall profile saves permanently. Each forecast lets you make temporary adjustments — add a seasonal item, remove something you're skipping today — without touching your saved profile.
